# The Memory Game
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## How to Play
* Flip two cards of your choice
  * If both cards match, cards will remain open
  * If the cards do not match, both cards will be flipped back down
* You will continue flipping cards until all cards have been flipped open
* Your star rating will depend on how many moves you used
* The timer will start once you flip your first card
